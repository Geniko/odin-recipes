        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>18 ounces of peanut butter; there are 18oz jars sold</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 and 1/4 cups sugar</li>
            <li>An additional 1/2 cup sugar for rolling the cookies in</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350F.</li>
            <li>Add 1 and 1/4 cup sugar, the peanut butter, and eggs together in a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Once incorporated, roll dough-like mixture into inch-sized balls.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar set aside for rolling in a bowl and coat your peanut butter balls.</li>
            <li>Try and place the balls on a cookie sheet about the same width apart as you made the cookies.</li>
            <li>Cooking time is around 12 minutes or until the cookies are slighly more brown and cracking on top.</li>
            <li>These cookies are pretty delicate coming out of the oven, so wait a couple minutes after taking them out; then, carefully lay them on a cooling rack.</li>
            <li>Wait . . . yes, wait - for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Now</strong> enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Makes around 35 cookies.</p>
