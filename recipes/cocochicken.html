        <p>I find that coconut flakes make a great alternative to breadcrumbs for baking chicken tenders. My preference is to use thigh meat (or dark meat) cut into tenders, but if you want use breast meat, go right ahead. Breast meat just has a habit of drying out faster.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

            <li>1lb of chicken thighs cut into tender size - chicken should not be frozen</li>

            <li>2 cups (at least) of unsweetened coconut flakes</li>
            <li>2 tsp of salt</li>
            <li>(optional) Try black pepper, garlic, and paprika to spice up the coating.*</li>
        </ul>
        <p>*Honestly, use whatever spices you deem would be delicious.</p>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>

            <li>Take two bowls: in one, crack the two eggs and whisk them; in the other, put your coconut flakes and any spices.</li>
