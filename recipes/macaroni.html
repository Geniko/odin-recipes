    <p>Do you think that making macaroni and cheese from scratch is too labor intensive? Do you think that you must make a huge pile of dishes? Not so! Put down that box of "instant" mac n' cheese - blue or otherwise - and make "EZ" macaroni and cheese in just about the same time with barely more effort.</p>
    <p>This recipe is highly customizable and takes two pots plus some utensils. Let's get started!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dry elbow (macaroni) pasta</li>
        <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter or lard/bacon fat</li>
        <li>2 cups milk; warmed is best</li>
        <li>1 cup (or to taste) shredded cheddar cheese (the sharper, the better, in my opinion)</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt, if it tastes like it needs it</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <h3>For the pasta:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the pasta in four cups of water until it is to your desired tenderness.</li>
        <li>Drain and strain.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If your pasta happens to cook faster than your sauce, run the pasta under cool water to cease cooking.</p>    
    <h3>For the cheese sauce, which you'll make while your pasta is boilng:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a four-quart pot on medium heat, and add the butter. Make sure it reaches temperature, but doesn't burn (unless you like that sort of thing).</li>
        <li>While stirring, add the flour a bit at a time to make a smooth paste consistancy - not dough!</li>
        <li>Take the milk and slowly add it to the paste whilst stirring. It may take a moment, but the sauce should thicken up to the point where there will be a clean line if you run your finger across the stirring spoon.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat (or turn to low).</li>
        <li>Add shredded cheese until it is melted and fully incorporated into the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add ground black pepper or other spices to your liking.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">    
        <li>Add your cooked pasta and stir.</li>
        <li>Finally, serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
